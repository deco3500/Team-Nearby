###Introduction

####**Aim**

To create an application which broadcasts current/future nearby events to users, as well as keeping users educated with the events they’re interested in. 

####**Dilemma and Case**

One of the biggest dilemmas affecting the general public is finding activities to participate in when you have time off. For example, travellers are never faced with a back to back schedule when they’re travelling so when they have free time, they may want to make spontaneous decisions to go participate in an event. However, in a foreign city, travellers may feel lost or stumped with where to start looking. This dilemma also apply for locals who feel like they’ve exhausted their city’s activities, not knowing that they’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg. Our team has came up with an idea to combat the barrier that these individuals face. 


###Concept

Eventus is a mobile application that allow users to retrieve information about current and upcoming nearby events around the user’s location. The events that are on offer cover genres such as performing arts, festivals, concerts and sporting events. By using the GPS function that’s available on the user’s smart-device, Eventus will automatically scan for nearby events to present to the user. 

####**Target Audience**

Eventus targets those who seek entertainment and activities to participate in around the user’s specific location. Some examples are tourists, travelers, and people who want to get information regarding nearby events. The app contains categories that caters to everyone's interests, no matter age, gender, culture, religion or etc.

####**Source of Events**

Special events can be posted by event organisers, these organisers must be authenticated by passing several requirements before listing an event. The process requires Event organisers to provide the project officer’s contact details, with a link to their offered event. Once approved, the platform will provide a one time code to the project officer email or phone number, which will post the event the organiser uploaded prior. Apart from that, the app will gather data from trusted local sources, such as Eventbrite or the city council’s database.

####**Technical Concepts and Features**

The application will utilize geofencing technique, so if the user is near to the posted event’s location, the application will notify the user. The user can bookmark the event or even share it to the users through social networking applications, such as Facebook or Twitter. Users can see the detailed information and ratings regarding the event within the app. In addition, user can follow the updates of the bookmarked events. Updates will be sent real time to the users. Event organizer also can share promotional code through this application.  

####**Different Offerings with Other Competitors**

This application focuses on providing information of nearby events using the user’s current location. Comparing to other applications, such as Eventbrite, Eventus caters to the user by giving suggestions and offers. The app also takes into consideration the travel a user may need to make to the event. By allowing authenticated Event organisers to upload events, this creates an exclusivity effect on some last minute events which differs us from Eventbrite. This component will make sure users aren’t going to miss out on any potential event they might be interested in. Users can provide feedback on every event or venue they’ve attended which also means, they can see the feedback on other events and venues.

###Team

**Our team consists of four people. The below table describes the role of each member and the description of each member**

Team member | Role | Member description
------------|------|-------------------
Joseph Teo | Front end, content, design and presentation | Team Leader
William Henry | Back end and front end | In charge of logistics**
Muhammad Fauzan Aidi | Front end and content | Team member
Henry Zhou | Design and content | Team member

***) logistics in this case is responsible for managing a place for a meeting outside workshop hours.*

####**Decision Making**

Decision, ideas and suggestions will be discussed together as a team before a common consensus is made. Voting may be used when necessary. 

####**Handling Poor Performance**

We will talk to the related member and find out the obstacles that the member experience with. After finding the obstacles, we will find the solution together. 

####**Conflicts Resolution**

For conflict resolution, we will discuss the problem with the involved team members and find the solution together. If the problem cannot be solved by us, we will ask the tutors or lecturer for the solution regarding the problem.

####**Team Communication**

* Each of member will use Facebook Messanger to communicate with each others. 
* If a member couldn't come to the meeting, that person should tell the others on Facebook Messanger.
* If a member couldn't come on time to the meeting, that person should tell the others on Facebook Messanger.

###Communications

####**Team Meeting**

The Team will meet during the workshop hours at the University of Queensland and will arrange to meet outside campus hours at a prearranged venue as required. 

####**Communication Tools and File Naming Convention**

Facebook messenger is the choice of use for our team’s communication. Files will be stored and shared on Google Drive. The file naming convention will be: [Team Nearby]xxxxx.

Facebook and Slack will be used as our social platforms. Facebook was chosen because it everyone is already on it and it is very much integrated into our lives, it is an multi-platform and messages are stored on their servers so it is easy to retrieve information no matter what devices are used. Slack is an effective team communication platform with is widely used by UQ students, it integrates with other services like Trello, Github. A useful feature it has is also the ability to have group communication and one to one communication in the same space.  

Github also will be used by our team as a version control system and ZenHub for managing and tracking issues on Github.

###Plan

The project plan would be carried out in numerous stages, by planning and coordinating allocated tasks between team members, steady and consistent contribution, the team will fall nothing short of success.

First the team needs to have a strong understanding of the proposed idea, research for other existing products or ideas that are similar and develop differences between our idea and the product found, this process will boost the members confidence, which will help future endeavours. From there, the team needs to discuss the direction to take for the first prototype; from interfaces to design, everything needs to be discussed. By using sketches, paper prototypes, colour palette samples, and user feedback, the first prototype will give a strong insight on the strength and weaknesses of the design. By digesting the information from the feedback, the team can re-iterate the initial prototype in preparation for round two of prototyping and user testing. The repeated process will always be running in a loop in order to fix any issues the design may create. We will adopt design sprint framework by Google Ventures. 

####**These are five days process of ideation based on design sprint by GV**

1. Day 1: We learn more about the proposed idea from the customer perspective. We will look who is the intended users and learn what they need. We also learn from the competitors point of view by searching what is their advantages and disadvantages.
2. Day 2: Formulate the solutions and ideate from the proposed solutions.
3. Day 3: Choose one of the idea and make storyboard of the selected idea.
4. Day 4: Build a rough prototype. The focus here is the usability not design.
5. Day 5: Show the prototype to the users not from our group (probably from tutors or other students) and receive feedback from the users.

The project development should be divided into several cycles. This product will be developed by using Scrum framework.

####**This are the project iteration plan**

1. Sprint 0: Project preparation and planning. In this stage, we will prepare everything to make this application. The activities are making the mockups of the application, preparing the development environment, designing the database, dividing the epics into several stories and later divide the stories into tasks, making testing criteria and making the API blueprint.
2. Sprint 1: Start developing and testing the major parts of the application. However before the start of Cycle 1, we need to talk to each other and try to assign each task to each member. The deliverables in this cycle is the application but limited to major features only.
3. Sprint 2: Start developing and testing the minor parts of the application and refining the major parts based on the received critiques. This is the last cycle for this project development. The deliverables in this cycle is the complete application.

####**Milestones**

* We will try to finish the entire cycle / sprint 0 by week 8. In this week, we will demonstrate about the idea and feature of the application, database design, prototype of the application, API blueprint and user stories. We will use the demo session on workshop 2 to gain insightful feedback.
* We will end our sprint 1 by week 11. However on week 10, we will show our progress to the tutors, lecturer and other students to get feedback for the major part of the running product.
* We will end our sprint 1 by week 14. However on week 12, we will show our progress to the tutors, lecturer and other students to get feedback for the non-finalised running product.

####**Resources**

By using the resources provided to us with current technology, knowledge and research, the team will be able to carry out important tasks for Eventus to be developed. We need a mobile developer to develop this application with a knowledge of relational database, server side development and client side development. We are likely going to develop this application by using Ionic Framework not native mobile application. We also need a UX skill for designing an application that is intuitive to be used by anyone. 

Ultimately, innovation is not a one step process and it always needs feedback. Feedback is going to be our guidance for evolution on Eventus. With the project eventually reaching the stages of publishing, there will be on field tests that need to be performed, at that time, resources supporting the content will be required in order to enact a real world scenario for user testing.
