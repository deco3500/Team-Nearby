###Introduction

####**Aim**

To create an application which broadcasts current/future nearby events to users, as well as keeping users educated with the events they’re interested in. 

####**Dilemma and Case**

One of the biggest dilemmas affecting the general public is finding activities to participate in when you have time off. For example, travellers are never faced with a back to back schedule when they’re travelling so when they have free time, they may want to make spontaneous decisions to go participate in an event. However, in a foreign city, travellers may feel lost or stumped with where to start looking. This dilemma also apply for locals who feel like they’ve exhausted their city’s activities, not knowing that they’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg. Our team has came up with an idea to combat the barrier that these individuals face. 


###Concept

Eventus is a mobile application that allow users to retrieve information about current and upcoming nearby events around the user’s location. The events that are on offer cover genres such as performing arts, festivals, concerts and sporting events. By using the GPS function that’s available on the user’s smart-device, Eventus will automatically scan for nearby events to present to the user. 

####**Target Audience**

Eventus targets those who seek entertainment and activities to participate in around the user’s specific location. Some examples are tourists, travelers, and people who want to get information regarding nearby events. The app contains categories that caters to everyone's interests, no matter age, gender, culture, religion or etc.

####**Source of Events**

Special events can be posted by event organisers, these organisers must be authenticated by passing several requirements before listing an event. The process requires Event organisers to provide the project officer’s contact details, with a link to their offered event. Once approved, the platform will provide a one time code to the project officer email or phone number, which will post the event the organiser uploaded prior. Apart from that, the app will gather data from trusted local sources, such as Eventbrite or the city council’s database.

####**Technical Concepts and Features**

The application will utilize geofencing technique, so if the user is near to the posted event’s location, the application will notify the user. The user can bookmark the event or even share it to the users through social networking applications, such as Facebook or Twitter. Users can see the detailed information and ratings regarding the event within the app. In addition, user can follow the updates of the bookmarked events. Updates will be sent real time to the users. Event organizer also can share promotional code through this application.  

####**Different Offerings with Other Competitors**

This application focuses on providing information of nearby events using the user’s current location. Comparing to other applications, such as Eventbrite, Eventus caters to the user by giving suggestions and offers. The app also takes into consideration the travel a user may need to make to the event. By allowing authenticated Event organisers to upload events, this creates an exclusivity effect on some last minute events which differs us from Eventbrite. This component will make sure users aren’t going to miss out on any potential event they might be interested in. Users can provide feedback on every event or venue they’ve attended which also means, they can see the feedback on other events and venues.

###Team

**Our team consists of four people. The below table describes the role of each member and the description of each member**

Team member | Role | Member description
------------|------|-------------------
Joseph Teo | Front end, content, design and presentation | Team Leader
William Henry | Back end and front end | In charge of logistics**
Muhammad Fauzan Aidi | Front end and content | Team member
Henry Zhou | Design and content | Team member

***) logistics in this case is responsible for managing a place for a meeting outside workshop hours.*

####**Decision Making**

Decision, ideas and suggestions will be discussed together as a team before a common consensus is made. Voting may be used when necessary. 

####**Handling Poor Performance**

We will talk to the related member and find out the obstacles that the member experience with. After finding the obstacles, we will find the solution together. 

####**Conflicts Resolution**

For conflict resolution, we will discuss the problem with the involved team members and find the solution together. If the problem cannot be solved by us, we will ask the tutors or lecturer for the solution regarding the problem.

####**Team Communication**

* Each of member will use Facebook Messanger to communicate with each others. 
* If a member couldn't come to the meeting, that person should tell the others on Facebook Messanger.
* If a member couldn't come on time to the meeting, that person should tell the others on Facebook Messanger.

###Communications

####**Team Meeting**

The Team will meet during the workshop hours at the University of Queensland and will arrange to meet outside campus hours at a prearranged venue as required. 

####**Communication Tools and File Naming Convention**

Facebook messenger is the choice of use for our team’s communication. Files will be stored and shared on Google Drive. The file naming convention will be: [Team Nearby]xxxxx.

Facebook and Slack will be used as our social platforms. Facebook was chosen because it everyone is already on it and it is very much integrated into our lives, it is an multi-platform and messages are stored on their servers so it is easy to retrieve information no matter what devices are used. Slack is an effective team communication platform with is widely used by UQ students, it integrates with other services like Trello, Github. A useful feature it has is also the ability to have group communication and one to one communication in the same space.  

Github also will be used by our team as a version control system and ZenHub for managing and tracking issues on Github.
