#Team Nearby
##For the Nearby project idea.

###Intorduction

Our team wants to create an application to enable users to know what local events occur near their area and receive any update regarding that event. 

We found that one of the biggest dilemma in local event is some people might still have difficulties in gaining the information and updates, for example if a traveller from other country or city visits Brisbane and he wants to know what musical events to visit in the city tonight, the traveller can search for the information in Facebook or Google. However, some events in a city or small area are not covered in Facebook or Google. In the above example, the traveller decides to go back to the hotel while a bar near that hotel held a jazz night. Our project goal is to overcome that problem.


###Concept

Eventus is a mobile application that allow users to retrieve information about current and upcoming local events within user’s location such as performing arts, festivals, concerts and sport events. Eventus will automatically scan nearby events by using geolocation technology from user’s device. 

####**Target Audience**

Eventus is intended for those who seek entertainments and events within the user’s specific location, commonly for tourists, travelers, and people who want to get information regarding nearby events. Eventus is also not concentrated in a particular group of audience, because it contains list of categories made for everyone's interests.

####**Source of Events**

The event can be posted by everyone with several requirements to verify the authenticity of the event. There are two roles for sharing event which are event organizer and ordinary users. Event organizer should put the project officer’s contact details or website or Facebook business page, then the platform will verify the provided information by sharing one time code the project’s officer email or phone number. The team plans to gather the local events data from trusted data sources, such as Eventbrite or the city council’s database. However, if there are two events published even though they are the same event, the application can make sure only one event is published. This can be achieved by comparing the location, date, time and name of the event with the stored event.

####**Technical Concepts and Features**

The application will utilize geofencing technique, so if the user is near to the posted event’s location, the application will notify the user. The user can bookmark the event or even share it to the users through social networking applications, such as Facebook or Twitter. User can see the detailed information regarding the event. In addition, user can follow the updates of the bookmarked events. Updates will be sent real time to the users. Event organizer also can share promotional code through this application. In addition, this application can shows live tweets or discussion from Twitter.

####**Different Offerings with Other Competitors**

This application focuses on the user’s current location while other applications, such as Eventbrite, focus on being an event catalog in a city of country. User can provide rate to each event that the user attends and they can see the rating of the event.

###Team

**Our team consists of four people. The below table describes the role of each member and the description of each member**

Team member | Role | Member description
------------|------|-------------------
Joseph Teo | Front end, content, design and presentation | Team Leader
William Henry | Back end and front end | In charge of logistics
Muhammad Fauzan Aidi | Front end and content | Team member
Henry Zhou | Design and content | Team member

####**Decision Making**

Decision, ideas and suggestions will be discussed together as a team before a common consensus is made. Voting may be used when necessary. 

####**Handling Poor Performance**

We will talk to the related member and find out the obstacles that the member experience with. After finding the obstacles, we will find the solution together. 

####**Conflicts Resolution**

For conflict resolution, we will discuss the problem with the involved team members and find the solution together. If the problem cannot be solved by us, we will ask the tutors or lecturer for the solution regarding the problem.

####**Team Communication**

* Each of member will use Facebook Messanger to communicate with each others. 
* If a member couldn't come to the meeting, that person should tell the others in Facebook Messanger.
* If a member couldn't come on time to the meeting, that person should tell the others in Facebook Messanger.
* If a member couldn't come to the meeting and couldn't tell the others on Facebook Messanger, we would contact that person by Facebook Messanger or call him.

###Communications

####**Team Meeting**
The Team will meet during the workshop hours at the University of Queensland and will arrange to meet outside school hours at a prearranged venue as required. Facebook messenger is the choice of use for our team’s communication. Files will be stored and shared on Google Drive. The file naming convention will be: [Team Nearby]xxxxx.

####**Communication Tools and File Naming Convention**
Facebook and Slack will be used as our social platforms. Facebook was chosen because it everyone is already on it and it is very much integrated into our lives, it is an multi-platform and messages are stored on their servers so it is easy to retrieve information no matter what devices are used. Slack is an effective team communication platform with is widely used by UQ students, it integrates with other services like Trello, Github. A useful feature it has is also the ability to have group communication and one to one communication in the same space.  

###Plan

The project plan would be carried out in numerous stages, by planning and coordinating allocated tasks between team members, steady and consistent contribution, the team will fall nothing short of success.

First the team needs to have a strong understanding of the proposed idea, research for other existing products or ideas that are similar and develop differences between our idea and the product found, this process will boost the members confidence, which will help future endeavours. From there, the team needs to discuss the direction to take for the first prototype; from interfaces to design, everything needs to be discussed. By using sketches, paper prototypes, colour palette samples, and user feedback, the first prototype will give a strong insight on the strength and weaknesses of the design. By digesting the information from the feedback, the team can re-iterate the initial prototype in preparation for round two of prototyping and user testing. The repeated process will always be running in a loop in order to fix any issues the design may create. We will adopt design sprint framework by Google Ventures. 

####**These are five days process of ideation based on design sprint by GV**

1. Day 1: We learn more about the proposed idea from the customer perspective. We will look who is the intended users and learn what they need. We also learn from the competitors point of view by searching what is their advantages and disadvantages.
2. Day 2: Formulate the solutions and ideate from the proposed solutions.
3. Day 3: Choose one of the idea and make storyboard of the selected idea.
4. Day 4: Build a rough prototype. The focus here is the usability not design.
5. Day 5: Show the prototype to the users not from our group (probably from tutors or other students) and receive feedback from the users.

The project development should be divided into several cycles. This product will be developed by using Scrum framework.

####**This are the project iteration plan**

1. Sprint 0: Project preparation and planning. In this stage, we will prepare everything to make this application. The activities are making the mockups of the application, preparing the development environment, designing the database, dividing the epics into several stories and later divide the stories into tasks, making testing criteria and making the API blueprint.
2. Sprint 1: Start developing and testing the major parts of the application. However before the start of Cycle 1, we need to talk to each other and try to assign each task to each member. The deliverables in this cycle is the application but limited to major features only.
3. Sprint 2: Start developing and testing the minor parts of the application and refining the major parts based on the received critiques. This is the last cycle for this project development. The deliverables in this cycle is the complete application.

####**Resources**

By using the resources provided to us with current technology, knowledge and research, the team will be able to carry out important tasks for Eventus to be developed. We need a mobile developer to develop this application with a knowledge of relational database, server side development and client side development. We are likely going to develop this application by using Ionic Framework not native mobile application. We also need a UX skill for designing an application that is intuitive to be used by anyone. 

Ultimately, innovation is not a one step process and it always needs feedback. Feedback is going to be our guidance for evolution on Eventus. With the project eventually reaching the stages of publishing, there will be on field tests that need to be performed, at that time, resources supporting the content will be required in order to enact a real world scenario for user testing.

####**Milestones**

* We will try to finish the entire cycle / sprint 0 by week 8. In this week, we will demonstrate about the idea and feature of the application, database design, prototype of the application, API blueprint and user stories. We will use the demo session on workshop 2 to gain insightful feedback.
* We will end our sprint 1 by week 11. However on week 10, we will show our progress to the tutors, lecturer and other students to get feedback for the major part of the running product.
* We will end our sprint 1 by week 14. However on week 12, we will show our progress to the tutors, lecturer and other students to get feedback for the non-finalised running product.
